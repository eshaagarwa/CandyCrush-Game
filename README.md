🛠️ **Unwrapping the Sweet World of Game Development: Candy Crush Game Project** 🛠️

🎉 Hello everyone! I'm thrilled to share my latest **Candy Crush Game** 🕹️ built using **Java**. If you've ever been fascinated by the candy-matching magic of Candy Crush, this project recreates that experience. From colorful candies 🍬 to strategic moves 🧠, this project brings the fun and challenge of the famous match-three game to life!

🚀 **Project Overview** 🚀

🍬 **Candy Crush Game Features** 🍬
- **Match-3 Mechanics**: Players swap candies to match three or more of the same color in a row or column, triggering a satisfying candy crush effect.
- **Score Calculation**: Each match adds points to the player's score, motivating them to achieve higher scores in limited moves.
- **Dynamic Grid**: When a match is made, candies disappear, and new candies fall from the top, making the game dynamic and unpredictable.
- **Game Loop**: The game runs in rounds, where players try to meet score targets within a set number of moves.

🛠️ **Technologies Used** 🛠️
- **Java**: The core programming language used for building the game.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: The game is structured with OOP principles, allowing for modular, maintainable, and scalable code.
- **2D Graphics**: Basic 2D graphics libraries in Java were used to render the candies, grid, and game interface.

🚀 **How to Play** 🚀
1. **Clone the repository**: [Candy Crush Game](https://github.com/eshaagarwa/CandyCrush-Game)
2. **Run the Project**: Open the project in your favorite IDE (like Eclipse or VSCode) and run the `Main.java` file to start playing.
3. **Swap & Match**: Click on two adjacent candies to swap them. Match three or more candies of the same type to crush them and score points!
4. **Aim for High Scores**: Keep matching and crushing candies to score as high as possible before running out of moves.

🌟 **Game Components** 🌟
- **Candy Matching Algorithm**: The core logic that checks if three or more candies of the same type are aligned, and triggers their removal.
- **Score Tracker**: Keeps track of the player's score, dynamically updating as candies are crushed.
- **Move Counter**: Limits the number of moves a player can make in each round, adding a strategic element to the game.

📜 **Code Structure** 📜
- **Main.java**: Contains the core game loop and user interaction.
- **Candy.java**: Represents the candy objects and their behavior.
- **GameBoard.java**: Manages the game grid and handles the candy swapping logic.

🚀 **Requirements** 🚀
- **IDE**: Works in any Java-supported IDE like Eclipse or VSCode.
- **Java Knowledge**: Some understanding of Java, especially **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, will help in grasping the game’s structure.

🌟 **Have Fun Matching!** 🌟  
Feel free to explore the code and immerse yourself in the world of candy matching 🍬. Contributions and feedback are always welcome. Let’s crush it together! 💥💻
